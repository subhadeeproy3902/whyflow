## Welcome to WhyFlow

WhyFlow is a decision observability system that helps you understand *why* your multi-step systems produce specific outcomes.

It's designed for AI-driven, rule-based, heuristic, and hybrid decision pipelines.

## Quick Start

Install WhyFlow:

```bash
pnpm add @whyflow/core
```

Create an execution and add decision steps:

```typescript
import { Execution } from "@whyflow/core";

const execution = new Execution("My Pipeline");

execution.addStep({
  name: "Filter Candidates",
  input: { candidates: 100 },
  output: { qualified: 23 },
  rationale: "Applied business rules to narrow candidates",
});

const data = execution.toJSON();
```

View the complete decision trail in the dashboard to debug and understand your system's decisions.
