## Decision Observability

Decision observability is about capturing *why* a system made a specific choice, not just *what* it did.

This requires capturing:

- The input to each decision point
- The options or candidates being considered
- The rules or evaluations applied
- The rationale behind the selection
- The final output

## Key Concepts

### DecisionExecution

A `DecisionExecution` represents a single run of your decision pipeline from start to finish.

It includes:

- **executionId**: Unique identifier for this run
- **name**: Human-readable name for the pipeline
- **timestamp**: When the execution started
- **steps**: Ordered list of decision steps

### DecisionStep

A `DecisionStep` represents a meaningful decision point in your pipeline, not just a function call.

Each step can include:

- **name**: What decision is being made
- **input**: What went into this step
- **output**: What came out of this step
- **rationale**: Human-readable explanation of why
- **metadata**: Additional context (filters applied, evaluations, rankings, etc.)

## What Makes a Good Decision Step?

A decision step should represent a **meaningful choice** in your system:

✅ Good Examples:
- "Filter Candidates by Price Range"
- "Rank Products by Review Count"
- "LLM Evaluation for Relevance"

❌ Bad Examples:
- "Call Database"
- "Parse JSON"
- "Log Result"

## The Mental Model

Think of WhyFlow as a **decision trail recorder**:

1. Create an execution when your pipeline starts
2. Add a step for each meaningful decision point
3. Capture inputs, outputs, and reasoning at each step
4. Visualize the complete trail in the dashboard

The goal is to make debugging feel like reading a story of how your system arrived at its conclusion.
