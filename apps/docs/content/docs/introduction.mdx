## What is WhyFlow?

WhyFlow is a **decision observability system** that captures and visualizes *why* a system produced a specific outcome.

It works for AI-driven, rule-based, heuristic, and hybrid decision pipelines.

## The Problem

Modern software increasingly relies on multi-step, non-deterministic processes where traditional logging and tracing fall short. You can see *what* happened, but not *why* a particular decision was made.

Consider a competitor selection system for an e-commerce platform:

1. Generate search keywords from a product description (LLM step)
2. Search and retrieve candidate products (API step)
3. Apply filters (price range, rating, reviews)
4. Evaluate relevance with an LLM
5. Rank and select the best match

If the selected competitor is wrong, which step failed? Without visibility into each decision point, debugging becomes guesswork.

## How WhyFlow Helps

WhyFlow provides transparency into multi-step decision processes by:

- Capturing decision context at each step: inputs, candidates, filters, outcomes, and reasoning
- Making it easy to identify where things went wrong
- Visualizing the complete decision trail for a given execution

## WhyFlow vs Traditional Tracing

| Aspect | Traditional Tracing | WhyFlow |
|--------|---------------------|---------|
| Focus | Performance & flow | Decision reasoning |
| Data | Spans, timing, service calls | Candidates, filters, selection logic |
| Question answered | "What happened?" | "Why this output?" |
| Granularity | Function/service level | Business logic level |

Traditional distributed tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin) answers: *"What functions were called and how long did they take?"*

WhyFlow answers: *"Why did the system make this decision?"*
