---

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add @whyflow/core
```

## Basic Usage

### 1. Create an Execution

Start by creating a `DecisionExecution` for your pipeline run:

```typescript
import { Execution } from "@whyflow/core";

const execution = new Execution("Product Recommendation Pipeline");
```

### 2. Add Decision Steps

For each meaningful decision point, add a step:

```typescript
execution.addStep({
  name: "Filter by Price Range",
  input: {
    candidates: 50,
    priceMin: 10,
    priceMax: 100,
  },
  output: {
    qualified: 12,
    rejected: 38,
  },
  rationale: "Filtered products to match customer budget constraints",
  metadata: {
    priceRange: { min: 10, max: 100 },
    rejectionReasons: {
      tooExpensive: 25,
      tooCheap: 13,
    },
  },
});
```

### 3. Export the Execution

When your pipeline completes, export the execution data:

```typescript
const executionData = execution.toJSON();
```

This gives you a complete, serializable record of the decision trail.

## Visualizing the Output

The generated JSON data can be loaded into the **WhyFlow Decision Debugger**, a powerful dashboard for visualizing and analyzing the entire decision-making process.

The example dashboard now includes a one-click demo that showcases a complete "Competitor Selection" execution.

- **Run the Interactive Demo**: Simply click the "Run Interactive Demo" button to fetch and display the sample execution data. This simulates a real-world scenario where data is fetched from an API.
- **Explore the Visualization**: Dive into each step of the process, inspect the inputs and outputs, and understand the rationale behind every decision.

This interactive experience is the best way to understand the power of WhyFlow.

## Best Practices

### Capture Intent, Not Implementation

Don't log every function call. Focus on **decision points** where choices are made.

### Be Specific in Rationale

Instead of "Applied filters", write "Rejected 25 products: price above $60 max".

### Use Metadata for Details

Put detailed evaluations, rankings, and rule results in `metadata`. Keep `input` and `output` high-level.

### Keep It JSON-Safe

Everything must be serializable. No functions, circular references, or complex objects.
